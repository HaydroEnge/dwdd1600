        <h1>Roshar</h1>
        <h2>Intro to Roshar</h2>
        <p>Allow me to introduce you to the wondrous and tempestuous world of Roshar. This remarkable planet is shaped
            by relentless highstorms, which carve the landscape and dictate the rhythm of life. The flora and fauna here
            have evolved to withstand these fierce tempests, resulting in a resilient and diverse ecosystem. As you
            traverse Roshar, you'll encounter a myriad of cultures, from the warlike Alethi to the enigmatic Parshendi
            and the reclusive Shin. Each society boasts its own unique customs and traditions, adding to the rich
            tapestry of this world. Magic on Roshar is a marvel to behold, deeply entwined with the presence of
            sprenâ€”ethereal beings that bond with humans, bestowing upon them extraordinary abilities. Prepare yourself
            for an unforgettable journey through a land where the very storms breathe life into the fabric of existence.
        </p>
        <p>Among the many wonders of Roshar, none are as legendary as the Knights Radiant. These ten ancient orders of
            warriors and scholars once protected humanity with their mystical Shardblades and Shardplates, drawing upon
            the power of spren to perform incredible feats.
